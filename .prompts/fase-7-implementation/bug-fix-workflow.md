# Bug/Defect Fixing

> AI-guided bug analysis, triage, fix implementation, and complete Jira documentation.

---

## Purpose

Analyze, triage, and fix bugs/defects reported during exploratory testing or production. This prompt helps the AI:

1. **Gather full context** from Jira (issue, comments, links, related stories)
2. **Reproduce the bug** using available testing tools
3. **Triage** to determine if it's a real bug, enhancement, or duplicate
4. **Implement the fix** with minimal changes following code standards
5. **Verify the fix** passes typecheck, lint, build, and manual testing
6. **Create branch, commit, and PR** with proper documentation
7. **Document in Jira** with root cause analysis and fix details
8. **Provide educational feedback** to improve bug report quality (optional)

**Prerequisites:**

- Bug reported in Jira (from exploratory testing or production)
- Access to Atlassian MCP tools (`mcp__atlassian__*`)
- Access to GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Optional: Browser testing tools (e.g., Playwright MCP)
- Optional: API testing tools (e.g., Postman MCP)
- Optional: Context7 MCP for library documentation

**Important:** This prompt is primarily configured for the **UPEX Galaxy Jira Workspace**. The custom field IDs below are shared across all projects in this workspace. For external workspaces, see the **Fallback Strategy** section.

## Fallback Strategy (Non-UPEX Workspaces)

> Apply when using this prompt in Jira workspaces OTHER than UPEX Galaxy.

### Fallback 1: Search for Equivalent Field

When a custom field ID fails, use `mcp__atlassian__jira_search_fields`:

```
Tool: mcp__atlassian__jira_search_fields
{
  "keyword": "root cause"  // or "severity", "error type", etc.
}
```

If found:

1. Use discovered field ID for this session
2. Inform user: "Using `customfield_XXXXX` for [Field Name] in this workspace"
3. Proceed with fix workflow

### Fallback 2: Ask User to Define Fields

```
⚠️ Custom Field Not Found

The field "[Field Name]" (UPEX ID: `customfield_XXXXX`) doesn't exist.

Options:
1. Tell me the correct custom field ID for this workspace
2. Skip this field and include info in the Jira comment
3. Proceed without updating this field

Which would you prefer?
```

### Fallback 3: Include in Comment

As last resort:

1. **Omit the custom field** from update
2. **Add info to Jira comment** in structured format
3. Note to user which fields were unavailable

---

## Required Context

**MUST gather this information before starting:**

### 1. Bug Issue from Jira

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The Atlassian MCP may not return custom fields with `fields: "*all"`. Make TWO calls to ensure complete data.

**Call 1 - Standard fields:**

```
Tool: mcp__atlassian__jira_get_issue
Parameters:
- issue_key: "PROJ-123"
- fields: "*all"
- expand: "changelog"
- comment_limit: 50
```

**Call 2 - Custom fields explicitly:**

```
Tool: mcp__atlassian__jira_get_issue
Parameters:
- issue_key: "PROJ-123"
- fields: "customfield_10109,customfield_10110,customfield_10112,customfield_10116,customfield_12210,customfield_10701,customfield_10111,customfield_10607,customfield_12212"
```

**Extract from combined results:**

- Summary and Description
- Steps to Reproduce
- **Actual Result** (customfield_10109) vs **Expected Result** (customfield_10110)
- **Error Type** (customfield_10112) and **Severity** (customfield_10116)
- **Test Environment** (customfield_12210)
- **Root Cause** (customfield_10701) - may be empty initially
- All comments (context, discussions, prior attempts)
- Attachments (screenshots, logs)

### 2. Linked Issues

Check issue links for:

- **Parent User Story:** Understand the original requirement and AC
- **Related bugs:** Check for duplicates or related issues
- **Blocked/Blocking:** Dependencies that might affect the fix

### 3. Code Standards (when implementing fix)

```
.context/guidelines/DEV/
├── code-standards.md           # Coding standards (DRY, naming, TypeScript)
├── error-handling.md           # Error handling patterns
└── data-testid-standards.md    # Test attributes (if UI fix)
```

### 4. Git Strategy

**Default branching pattern (user can override):**

| Type       | Branch Pattern                         | Target      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Bugfix** | `fix/{ISSUE_KEY}/{short-description}`  | staging     |
| **Hotfix** | `hotfix/{ISSUE_KEY}/{short-description}` | main      |

**Ask user if they have a different git strategy before creating branches.**

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Bug Context Gathering

**Objective:** Understand the bug completely before attempting to fix.

**Step 1: Read the bug issue (TWO CALLS REQUIRED)**

> **CRITICAL:** The Atlassian MCP may not return custom fields with `fields: "*all"`. You MUST make TWO separate calls to ensure you have all information.

**Call 1 - Standard fields and comments:**

```
Tool: mcp__atlassian__jira_get_issue
Parameters:
- issue_key: "[BUG_ID]"
- fields: "*all"
- expand: "changelog"
- comment_limit: 50
```

**Call 2 - Custom fields explicitly (REQUIRED):**

```
Tool: mcp__atlassian__jira_get_issue
Parameters:
- issue_key: "[BUG_ID]"
- fields: "customfield_10109,customfield_10110,customfield_10112,customfield_10116,customfield_12210,customfield_10701,customfield_10111,customfield_10607,customfield_12212"
```

**Why two calls?**
- Call 1: Gets summary, description, status, comments, changelog
- Call 2: Explicitly retrieves custom field VALUES (Actual/Expected Result, Severity, Error Type, etc.)

**If custom fields return `null` or "field not found":**
1. Use `mcp__atlassian__jira_search_fields` to find equivalent fields
2. Ask user for correct field IDs (see Fallback Strategy section)
3. Do NOT assume fields are empty without verifying

**Step 2: Extract and present critical information**

```markdown
## Bug Analysis: [BUG_ID]

**Summary:** [Title]
**Reported by:** [Reporter] on [Date]
**Assignee:** [Assignee or Unassigned]

**Classification:**
| Field           | Value           |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Error Type      | [Type]          |
| Severity        | [Severity]      |
| Environment     | [Environment]   |
| Priority        | [Priority]      |

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

**Expected Result:**
[Expected behavior]

**Actual Result:**
[Actual behavior/bug]

**Comments Summary:** [X comments]
- [Key points from discussion]

**Attachments:** [List or "None"]

**Linked Issues:**
- Parent Story: [STORY-XXX] or "Not linked"
- Related Bugs: [List or "None"]
```

**Step 3: Check for duplicates**

```
Tool: mcp__atlassian__jira_search
JQL: project = [PROJECT] AND type = Bug AND status != Done
     AND summary ~ "[keywords]" AND key != [CURRENT_BUG]
```

**If potential duplicate found:**

```
⚠️ Potential Duplicate Detected

This bug may be a duplicate of [EXISTING-BUG]:
- Summary: [Summary]
- Status: [Status]
- Similarity: [What matches]

Options:
1. Mark as duplicate and link to [EXISTING-BUG]
2. Continue as separate bug (different root cause)
3. Let me investigate further

Which would you prefer?
```

---

### Phase 2: Bug Reproduction

**Objective:** Confirm the bug is reproducible before implementing a fix.

**Reproduction approach by bug type:**

| Bug Type          | Reproduction Method                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **UI Bug**        | Browser testing tools (if available)          |
| **API Bug**       | API testing tools or curl commands            |
| **Code/Logic Bug**| Code inspection and trace                     |
| **Data Bug**      | Database queries or API verification          |

**For UI Bugs (if browser tools available):**

1. Navigate to the affected page
2. Follow steps to reproduce exactly
3. Capture screenshot if bug manifests
4. Note any console errors or network failures

**For API Bugs:**

1. Replicate the API call with same parameters
2. Capture response and status code
3. Compare with expected behavior

**For Code/Logic Bugs:**

1. Identify the code path from the bug description
2. Trace through the logic
3. Identify where behavior diverges from expected

**Document reproduction results:**

```markdown
## Reproduction Results

**Attempt 1:** [Date/Time]
- Steps executed: [List]
- Result: ✅ Reproduced / ❌ Not Reproduced / ⚠️ Intermittent
- Evidence: [Screenshot path / Log excerpt / None]

**Conclusion:**
- [ ] Bug confirmed reproducible → Proceed to Phase 3
- [ ] Bug NOT reproducible → Request more info
- [ ] Bug is intermittent → Note timing/race condition
```

**If NOT reproducible:**

```
⚠️ Unable to Reproduce Bug

I followed the steps but could not reproduce the issue.

Possible reasons:
1. Environment difference (I'm on [env], bug reported on [env])
2. Missing preconditions (user state, data setup)
3. Bug already fixed in current code
4. Timing/race condition issue

Options:
1. Add Jira comment requesting more details from reporter
2. Check git history for recent fixes that might have resolved this
3. Close as "Cannot Reproduce" with documentation

Which would you prefer?
```

---

### Phase 3: Triage & Decision

**Objective:** Determine the correct course of action based on analysis.

**Decision Matrix:**

| Finding                        | Action                           | Jira Transition         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Real bug, reproducible         | Proceed to fix                   | → In Progress           |
| Duplicate of existing bug      | Link and close                   | → Duplicate             |
| Not a bug (works as designed)  | Document reasoning               | → Won't Fix (WAD)       |
| Enhancement request            | Reclassify as enhancement        | → Enhancement / Backlog |
| Cannot reproduce               | Request more info or close       | → Need Info / Cannot Reproduce |
| Deferred (low priority/risk)   | Document and defer               | → Deferred              |

**For "Real Bug" - Check if Hotfix needed:**

```markdown
## Fix Type Determination

**Severity:** [Crítica/Mayor/Moderada/Menor/Trivial]
**Environment:** [Dev/QA/UAT/Staging/Production]

**Hotfix Criteria:**
- [ ] Severity is "Crítica"
- [ ] Found in Production environment
- [ ] Blocking critical business flow

**Decision:**
- [ ] **HOTFIX** → Use `hotfix/*` branch, PR to main
- [ ] **BUGFIX** → Use `fix/*` branch, PR to staging
```

**For "Not a Bug" scenarios:**

```
I've analyzed this issue and determined it's NOT a bug.

**Classification:** Working As Designed (WAD)

**Analysis:**
[Detailed explanation of why this is expected behavior]

**Reference:**
- AC from [STORY-XXX]: "[Quote the AC]"
- Design decision: [Reference if documented]

**Recommendation:**
[Close as WAD / Convert to enhancement / Other]

Do you want me to:
1. Close this issue with documentation
2. Convert to enhancement request
3. Let me investigate further
```

**Transition to In Progress (if real bug):**

```
Tool: mcp__atlassian__jira_transition_issue
Parameters:
- issue_key: "[BUG_ID]"
- transition: "In Progress"
```

---

### Phase 4: Implementation of Fix

**Objective:** Implement minimal, targeted fix following code standards.

**Step 1: Root Cause Analysis**

```markdown
## Root Cause Analysis

**Category:** [Code Error / Config Error / Third-Party / etc.]

**Location:**
- File: `[path/to/file.ts]`
- Function/Component: `[functionName / ComponentName]`
- Line(s): [approximate lines]

**Technical Explanation:**
[Detailed explanation of what causes the bug]

**Why it happens:**
[The logic error / missing check / incorrect assumption]
```

**Step 2: Create Fix Branch**

Determine branch type based on Phase 3 decision:

```bash
# For standard BUGFIX:
git checkout -b fix/[ISSUE_KEY]/[short-description]
# Example: git checkout -b fix/PROJ-123/email-validation

# For HOTFIX (critical production bug):
git checkout -b hotfix/[ISSUE_KEY]/[short-description]
# Example: git checkout -b hotfix/PROJ-456/payment-crash
```

**Step 3: Implement Fix**

**Guidelines:**

- **Minimal changes:** Fix only what's broken
- **Don't refactor:** Unless directly related to the bug
- **Follow code standards:** `.context/guidelines/DEV/code-standards.md`
- **Error handling:** `.context/guidelines/DEV/error-handling.md`
- **Add data-testid:** If UI element involved (for future automation)
- **Consider edge cases:** Related scenarios that might be affected

**Document the change:**

```markdown
## Fix Implementation

**Files Modified:**
| File | Change Description |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| `[file1.ts]` | [What changed] |
| `[file2.ts]` | [What changed] |

**Before (problematic code):**
```[language]
[old code snippet]
```

**After (fixed code):**
```[language]
[new code snippet]
```

**Why this fixes it:**
[Explanation of how the fix addresses the root cause]
```

---

### Phase 5: Verification of Fix

**Objective:** Ensure fix works and doesn't break anything.

**Step 1: Code Quality Checks**

```bash
# TypeScript check (adjust command per project)
npm run typecheck  # or: bun run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint  # or: bun run lint

# Build
npm run build  # or: bun run build
```

**Step 2: Manual Verification**

1. Follow original steps to reproduce
2. Verify bug no longer occurs
3. Test related scenarios (regression check)
4. Capture evidence (screenshot if UI)

**Step 3: Run Tests (if available)**

```bash
npm run test  # or: bun run test
```

**Verification Checklist:**

```markdown
## Fix Verification

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] TypeScript: No errors
- [ ] Lint: No errors (or only pre-existing)
- [ ] Build: Successful

**Functional Verification:**
- [ ] Original bug: FIXED
- [ ] Steps to reproduce now show expected behavior
- [ ] Related scenarios: Not broken (regression check)
- [ ] Evidence captured: [Screenshot path or "N/A"]

**Tests:**
- [ ] Existing tests pass
- [ ] New test added for this scenario: [Yes/No/N/A]
```

---

### Phase 6: Git Flow (Branch, Commit, Push, PR)

**Step 1: Stage and Commit**

Use semantic commit format:

```bash
git add [files]
git commit -m "fix(ISSUE_KEY): brief description

- Root cause: [brief explanation]
- Fix: [what was changed]

Fixes: ISSUE_KEY"
```

**Commit Message Examples:**

```bash
# Standard bugfix
git commit -m "fix(PROJ-123): resolve email validation allowing invalid format

- Root cause: regex pattern missing anchor at end
- Fix: updated EMAIL_REGEX to include $ anchor

Fixes: PROJ-123"

# Hotfix
git commit -m "fix(PROJ-456): prevent payment crash on empty cart [HOTFIX]

- Root cause: null reference when cart items array undefined
- Fix: added null check before accessing cart.items

Fixes: PROJ-456"
```

**Step 2: Push Branch**

```bash
git push -u origin [branch-name]
```

**Step 3: Create Pull Request**

```bash
# For BUGFIX (to staging/develop)
gh pr create \
  --title "fix(ISSUE_KEY): brief description" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

- fields: {"assignee": "[qa-email@example.com]"}
```

---

### Phase 8: Educational Feedback (Optional)

> **Note:** This phase is OFF by default. Activate only when explicitly requested by the user.

**Objective:** Provide constructive feedback to improve future bug reports.

**When to activate:**

- User explicitly requests feedback mode
- User asks "give me feedback on this bug report"

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Verify Custom Fields Before Giving Feedback**

Before evaluating whether fields are "missing" or "incomplete":

1. **Ensure you made the explicit custom fields call** (Phase 1, Call 2)
2. **Re-verify if uncertain:** Make another call with explicit field IDs
3. **List found values:** In your feedback, show the ACTUAL values found
4. **Only mark as "missing" if the explicit call returned `null` or empty**

```
Tool: mcp__atlassian__jira_get_issue
Parameters:
- issue_key: "[BUG_ID]"
- fields: "customfield_10109,customfield_10110,customfield_10112,customfield_10116,customfield_12210,customfield_10701,customfield_10111,customfield_10607,customfield_12212"
```

**If fields return null after explicit call:** Then it's valid to note as missing in feedback.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Aspect              | Good                              | Needs Improvement              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Steps to Reproduce  | Clear, numbered, reproducible     | Vague, missing steps           |
| Expected vs Actual  | Specific, measurable              | Generic, unclear               |
| Error Type          | Correctly categorized             | Misclassified                  |
| Severity            | Appropriate to impact             | Over/under estimated           |
| Environment         | Specified correctly               | Missing or incorrect           |
| Evidence            | Screenshots, logs attached        | No evidence                    |
| User Story Link     | Linked to related story           | No traceability                |
| Title               | Follows nomenclature              | Unclear or too vague           |

```

---

## Edge Cases Handling

### Case 1: Bug Already Fixed

**Detection:** Code inspection shows problematic code no longer exists.

**Action:**

1. Verify fix is deployed to the environment where bug was reported
2. Add Jira comment documenting when/how it was fixed
3. Transition to Ready For QA (or close if already in production)

### Case 2: Bug Requires Breaking Change

**Detection:** Fix would break existing API/behavior used by other features.

**Action:**

1. **STOP** - Do not implement breaking change without approval
2. Document the impact in Jira comment
3. Ask user/PO for guidance on approach
4. Consider: deprecation strategy, feature flag, versioning

### Case 3: Bug in Third-Party Library

**Detection:** Root cause is in external dependency.

**Action:**

1. Check for newer version that fixes the issue
2. If no fix available:
   - Implement workaround in our code
   - Document as known limitation
   - Consider opening issue in library repo
3. Update Jira with third-party dependency info

### Case 4: Bug Affects Multiple Areas

**Detection:** Fix requires changes across multiple features/modules.

**Action:**

1. Scope the full impact before implementing
2. Consider splitting into multiple PRs if too large
3. Extra thorough regression testing
4. Document all affected areas in PR

### Case 5: Insufficient Information

**Detection:** Cannot understand or reproduce from bug report.

**Action:**

1. Add Jira comment with specific questions
2. Transition to "Need Info" status
3. List exactly what information is needed
4. Do NOT guess or assume

### Case 6: Security Bug

**Detection:** Bug involves security vulnerability (auth bypass, data exposure, XSS, etc.)

**Action:**

1. **DO NOT** discuss vulnerability details in public Jira comments
2. Use private/restricted channel if available
3. Prioritize as critical regardless of original severity
4. Consider if disclosure is needed after fix

## Multi-Bug Session Support

This section provides templates for handling multiple bugs in a single session.

### JQL Query for Pending Bugs

Use this query to get a list of bugs to work on:

```
project = [PROJECT_KEY] AND issuetype in (Bug, Defect) AND status = OPEN ORDER BY priority DESC, created ASC
```

**Tool usage:**

```
Tool: mcp__atlassian__jira_search
Parameters:
- jql: "project = PROJ AND issuetype in (Bug, Defect) AND status = OPEN ORDER BY priority DESC"
- fields: "summary,priority,status,reporter,created"
- limit: 20
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                                 | Solution                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| "Field customfield_XXXXX not found"   | Use Fallback Strategy (search or include in comment) |
| "Transition not valid"                | Check available transitions for current status       |
| Cannot reproduce bug                  | Request more info, check environment differences     |
| Fix breaks other tests                | Investigate regression, consider scope of fix        |
| PR conflicts                          | Rebase on target branch, resolve conflicts           |
| Hotfix needs backport                 | Use cherry-pick to apply to staging/develop          |

### Custom Fields Not Returned (Common Issue)

**Problem:** `jira_get_issue` with `fields: "*all"` returns standard fields but custom field values are `null` or missing.

**Root Cause:** The Atlassian MCP may not expand custom fields automatically.

**Solution:** Always make TWO calls:

1. **First call:** `fields: "*all"` for standard fields + comments
2. **Second call:** Explicitly list custom field IDs:
   ```
   fields: "customfield_10109,customfield_10110,customfield_10112,customfield_10116,customfield_12210,customfield_10701,customfield_10111,customfield_10607,customfield_12212"
   ```

**If still not found:**

1. Verify field exists: `mcp__atlassian__jira_search_fields` with keyword
2. Ask user for correct field ID
3. Check if field is only visible to certain roles/projects

**NEVER assume a field is empty without making the explicit call.**

### Incorrect Feedback Due to Missing Fields

**Problem:** AI gives feedback that custom fields are "missing" when they were actually filled.

**Root Cause:** AI only made one call with `fields: "*all"` and assumed empty = not filled.

**Prevention:**

1. Always make the second explicit call for custom fields
2. Before giving feedback on missing fields, verify with explicit field query
3. In Phase 8 (Feedback), explicitly list which fields WERE found and their values

**If you already gave incorrect feedback:**

1. Acknowledge the error to the user
2. Re-query with explicit field IDs
3. Provide corrected assessment
